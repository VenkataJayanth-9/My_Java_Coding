Concept Explanation:
1.Generic Classes: A generic class is a class that can work with any data type. Instead of specifying a concrete type for its members, you define them with type parameters. This allows you to create classes that are reusable with different data types.
2.Type Parameters: Type parameters are placeholders for types that will be specified when the class is instantiated. They are enclosed in angle brackets < > and can be any valid identifier.
3.Type Safety: Generics ensure type safety by allowing the compiler to perform type checks at compile time. This helps catch type-related errors early in the development process.

Important Points:
1.Syntax: Use angle brackets < > to specify type parameters when declaring a generic class.
2.Type Inference: In many cases, you don't need to explicitly specify the type parameter when instantiating a generic class. The compiler can often infer the type based on the context.
3.Multiple Type Parameters: You can define multiple type parameters for a generic class separated by commas.
4.Wildcards: Java generics also support wildcard types (?) to represent unknown types. Wildcards can be used when the exact type is irrelevant.
5.Type Bounds: You can restrict the types that can be used as type parameters by specifying upper bounds (<T extends SomeClass>) or lower bounds (<T super SomeClass>).
6.Type Erasure: Generics in Java use type erasure, meaning that generic type information is erased at runtime. This is done for backward compatibility with older Java code.
7.Generic Methods: In addition to generic classes, Java also supports generic methods, which are methods that can accept generic types.



Certainly! The diamond operator (<>) in Java is used for type inference when creating an object of a generic class. It allows you to omit the type parameters on the right side of the assignment if the type can be inferred from the context. Here's how it works along with some important points:

Concept Explanation:
1.Type Inference: The diamond operator (<>) was introduced in Java 7 to simplify the instantiation of generic classes. It allows the compiler to infer the type parameters based on the context.
2.Reduced Boilerplate: Using the diamond operator reduces code verbosity by eliminating the need to specify type parameters explicitly when creating objects of generic classes.
3.Readability: It improves code readability by making it clearer and more concise, especially when dealing with complex generic types.

Important Points:
1.Automatic Type Inference: The diamond operator allows the compiler to automatically determine the type parameters based on the context, reducing the need for explicit type declarations.
2.Compile-Time Safety: While type inference helps reduce boilerplate code, it does not compromise type safety. The compiler still ensures that the types are compatible and consistent.
3.Compatibility: The diamond operator is compatible with both generic classes and constructors, making it versatile for various use cases.
4.Use in Collections: The diamond operator is commonly used when working with collections (e.g., List<>, Map<>) to create instances without explicitly specifying the type parameters.
5.Clarity and Readability: While the diamond operator improves code conciseness, it's essential to use it judiciously to maintain code clarity and readability, especially in cases where type inference might not be obvious.



Bounded types and wildcards in Java generics are mechanisms to impose restrictions on the types that can be used with generic classes or methods. Bounded types restrict the types that can be used as type parameters, while wildcards allow for more flexibility in working with generic types. Here's an explanation along with code examples and important points:


Bounded types and wildcards in Java generics are mechanisms to impose restrictions on the types that can be used with generic classes or methods. Bounded types restrict the types that can be used as type parameters, while wildcards allow for more flexibility in working with generic types. Here's an explanation along with code examples and important points:

Bounded Types:
Bounded types specify constraints on the type parameters of a generic class or method. There are two types of bounds: upper bounds and lower bounds.

Upper Bounded Types: Use the extends keyword to specify an upper bound. This restricts the type parameter to be a subtype of the specified bound.
Lower Bounded Types: Use the super keyword to specify a lower bound. This restricts the type parameter to be a supertype of the specified bound.

Wildcards:
Wildcards are denoted by the ? symbol and provide more flexibility when working with generic types. There are three types of wildcards: unbounded wildcard, wildcard with an upper bound, and wildcard with a lower bound.

Unbounded Wildcard: Denoted by ?, it represents an unknown type.
Wildcard with Upper Bound: Denoted by <? extends SomeType>, it restricts the unknown type to be a subtype of SomeType.
Wildcard with Lower Bound: Denoted by <? super SomeType>, it restricts the unknown type to be a supertype of SomeType.


Important Points:
Bounded Types: Use bounded types when you need to restrict the type parameter to a specific type or its subtype/supertype.
Wildcards: Use wildcards when you need more flexibility and don't care about the exact type.
Type Safety: Bounded types and wildcards help ensure type safety by restricting the types that can be used with generic classes or methods.
Readability vs. Flexibility: Choose bounded types for more specific type restrictions and wildcards for more flexibility in type usage.
Avoid Raw Types: Whenever possible, avoid using raw types (e.g., List instead of List<?>) to benefit from compile-time type checking and improved readability.
